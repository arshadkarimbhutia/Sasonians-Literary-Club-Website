                    On April 9th, 2024, St. Augustine School’s DJ Hall was abuzz with innovation as it hosted a robotics
                    symposium for the senior science students of classes 11 and 12. The guest speakers were Dr. Dipanjan
                    Bhattacharjee and Rabin Dahal. It was to be noted that Mr. Sanjay Verma had been in touch with them
                    since a month and coordinated with them for a proper execution of this event.

                    After the operations and theories, the question session thus followed, to which the students were
                    full of curiosity and asked several questions about the operation of the drone. Major questions
                    consisted of drone stabilization, the role of Rigid Body Mechanics (RBM) in motor operation, and the
                    philosophical query of whether robots could surpass humans. To which, the presenters offered a
                    thought-provoking perspective:
                    “Creation cannot be greater than the creator.” Post-discussion, the students were asked to allot
                    themselves into a collaborative team of 5-10
                    members for the practical session.

                    They were all given arduino boards, chassis and some hardware for a basic wheel-bot. This board is
                    essentially a small computer in
                    which one uploads the code and program for the mechanics and technicalities of the robot to make
                    it work. He also focused on briefing students about the coding aspect of the bot's working. Dr.
                    Dipanjan then attempted an
                    experiment with his drone to showcase that if programmed not properly in an enclosed environment
                    a misstep in switching from altitude hold mode to auto pilot, will cause failure in the drone.

                    With this experiment he pointed out that failures happen and we should learn from our mistakes.
                    A team triumphed in assembling an Arduino Uno-based mobile vehicle, complete with sensors, which
                    operated flawlessly. Post-lunch, the students were tasked with programming their creations. With
                    sensor integration, they successfully achieved in moving their vehicles. Mr. Dahal supervised this
                    session, ensuring the functionality of each prototype. After being done with all the models the
                    guests finally concluded the event by performing a drone show and elaborating the process behind a
                    successful flight operation.

                    The school prefect, Aayan Yogesh Khati, articulated the collective gratitude of the students,
                    thanking the guests for their invaluable insights. In a gesture of appreciation, Father George
                    presented the guests with tokens of appreciation, celebrating their commitment to elucidating the
                    complexities of robotics to the students.
